# online-test-webapp
Hello, I made this sample app. I created this app using programming languages such that python, flask and pywebio. <br>

Pywebio is a module in python that allow developers to create web application without using HTML and CSS, we can also use pywebio with flask,Djnago and other web frameworks.

# Here are the Steps for running this project.
1. git clone<br>
2. pip install requirements.txt<br>
in case this command is not working use this ->
    pip install -r requirements.txt  
3. python app.py<br>

# Here is the Snapshots of web app

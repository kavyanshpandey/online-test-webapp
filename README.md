Hello, I made this simple app. I have created this app using programming languages such that python, flask and pywebio. <br>

Pywebio is a module in python that allow developers to create web application without using HTML and CSS, we can also use pywebio with flask,Djnago and other web frameworks.
Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries.

# Here are the Steps for running this project.
1. git clone<br>

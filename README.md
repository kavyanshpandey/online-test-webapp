# online-test-webapp
Hello, I made this sample app. I created this app using programming languages such that python, flask and pywebio. <br>

Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions.

Pywebio is a module in python that allow developers to create web application without using HTML and CSS, we can also use pywebio with flask,Djnago and other web frameworks.

# Here are the Steps for running this project.
1. git clone<br>
2. pip install requirements.txt<br>
3. python app.py<br>

# Here is the Snapshots of web app

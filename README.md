# online-test-webapp

Hello, I made this sample app. I created this app using programming languages such that python, flask and pywebio. <br>

Pywebio is a module in python that allow developers to create web application without using HTML and CSS, we can also use pywebio with flask,Djnago and other web frameworks.
some features of pywebio:-
1.Use synchronization instead of callback-based method to get input

2.Non-declarative layout, simple and efficient

3.Less intrusive: old script code can be transformed into a Web service only by modifying the input and output operation

4.Support integration into existing web services, currently supports Flask, Django, Tornado, aiohttp and FastAPI(Starlette) framework

# Here are the Steps for running this project.

1. git clone<br>
2. pip install requirements.txt<br>
3. python app.py<br>

# Here is the Snapshots of web app

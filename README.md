Hello, I made this sample app. I created this app using programming languages such that python, flask and pywebio. <br>

Pywebio is a module in python that allow developers to create web application without using HTML and CSS, we can also use pywebio with flask,Djnago and other web frameworks. PyWebIO provides a diverse set of imperative functions to obtain user input and output content on the browser, turning the browser into a "rich text".

# Here are the Steps for running this project.
1. git clone<br>
2. pip install requirements.txt<br>
3. python app.py<br>

# Here is the Snapshots of web app
